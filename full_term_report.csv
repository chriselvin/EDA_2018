        First, ''different  worlds'' is very discriminatory word. Actually  Sam  is deaf , so she cannot hear anything however  she is really sensitive girl . She can feel her mother' and Jim 's music from her body. Also we should not choose the discriminatory word for the book title. Because many people from young to old look at the title.

At first, actually  they cannot communication very much , however not because Sam is deaf but because Sam didn't have  courage  to talk to Jim . In the end Sam and Jim were happy and they love each other because Sam had courage to love him. So we should not assume  that Sam and Jim live in different  worlds only because she is deaf.

There are six kinds of ecosystems : Amazonia, the Cerrado and the Pamps, the Atlantic forest, the Cautings, the Pantanal and the Coast. Amazonia is the biggest rainforest in the world.

Brazil becomes a democracy again in 1872, there were only 270,000 immigrants in Brazil. Ninety years later, there were about five million immigrants. This included Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, German, Japanese and people from the Middle East. Many of these immigrants stayed , so now Brazil has people from Africa, Europe , Asia, and the Middle East. Some have different customs, but they are all Brazilian.
　　4th, education. There are fundamental education schools preschool, secondary school and university. The Brazilian government is trying to make schools better , and it has many education programs . Students study Portuguese, history, geography,   science, math sports, and dancing and other languages, like English and Spanish. In Brazil most people work very hard. This is one reason why the economy is strong.
    5th, nature. Brazil has the most animal and plants species in the world. This is because of the environment. However many of animal and species are in danger.   It's mainly because climate change and industry . Also , the forests are becoming  smaller , so it difficult for animals and plants .
    6th, traditions and celebrations. Festivals are an important tradition in Brazil. Many festivals are religious . For example, October 12th is the forest day of our Lady of Aparecida.  No one has to go to school or work . Because she is an important saint in Brazil.  Also in Brazil , birthdays are important . People might have parties. Fifteen is the most important year for girls .
